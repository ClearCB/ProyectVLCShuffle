# Proyect-VLC-shuffle

Make a program in python that creates a random song list and reproduces it at VLC.

I'll follow the code of my teacher and i'll try to implement everychange with git.

## First step

First of all i'll create modules that will allow me to check if the input is the correct one.

The first module will be called "songIsInList" and it will check if the song is acctually at the list.

Then ill make a module called "songIsUnique" and it will check if the song is repeated or not.

Since i forgot to import random and it will be needed later, ill import at this commit and add a new feature that will select a random song from the library.

We add a new featur which consist on creating a playlist so we have our dictionary with the songs.
