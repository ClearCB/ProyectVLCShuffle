# Proyect-VLC-shuffle

Make a program in python that creates a random song list and reproduces it at VLC.

I'll follow the code of my teacher and i'll try to implement everychange with git.

## First step

First of all i'll create modules that will allow me to check if the input is the correct one. 

The first module will be called "songIsInList" and it will check if the song is acctually at the list.

Then ill make a module called "songIsUnique" and it will check if the song is repeated or not.
